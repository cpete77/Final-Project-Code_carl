                    <img src="static/Work/proj1_norwoodSite.png" alt="Project 3 Image">
                    <p>My first project as a Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) engineer for a contract engineering firm was for the initial site Norwood site startup of Moderna in 2017. 
                        I was a junior engineer with a chemical engineering background and was just beginning to learn 
                        how automation could be applied to biotech processes.</p>

                    <img src="static/Work/lonza.png" alt="Project 3 Image">
                    <p>My next project was from 2018 to 2020 when I was sent to Lonza in Portsmouth, NH to help with the MES design of a new monoclonal antibody manufacturing suite 
                        that was being commissioned. Lonza is a contract manufacturing organziation (CMO) meaning they manufacture other companies products. I was able to learn from 
                        some of the best engineers in the industry at this site.

                    <h2>Third Project - Rubius Therapeutic Site Startup</h2>
                    <img src="static/Work/rubius.png" alt="Project 3 Image">
                    <p>In the summer of 2019 I needed to assist a small team with the MES design of a new plant being built in Rhode Island for Rubius Therapeuitics, a company building 
                        therapies based on biologically engineered red blood cells. The project fell behind so I needed to drop my current Lonza project to help with the design and build out.
                        I assisted with the design for three months before returning to Lonza. Although the therapy seemed promising, Rubius products failed clinical trials for its two products in 2022 and has since gone out of business and sold the site.

                    <p>In March 2020, the engineering firm I was working for moved me from the Lonza project to Moderna. I assisted with the MES design for the covid vaccine manufacturing
                        process and helped with the MES design for other clinical product lines. In 2021 I joined Moderna as a full time employee. I continue
                        to work on MES designs for the Norwood site and support the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia sites as well. My most recent project
                        is a major version upgrade of the MES application where the software and servers its run on will be updated and move from AWS to on-prem.

            <h2>What is MES</h2>
    <p>Manufacturing Execution Systems are specialized software solutions used to manage, monitor, and optimize production processes in real time. In the biotech industry, MES plays a crucial role in ensuring the production of 
        high-quality biopharmaceutical products while complying with strict regulatory standards like FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).</p>
    <p>MES provides real-time tracking of production processes, enabling biotech manufacturers to monitor critical parameters such as temperature, pH, 
        pressure, and other conditions required for biological processes like fermentation or cell culture.
        MES replaces paper-based batch records with electronic batch records, providing a digital, centralized system to document all production steps and quality checks. This helps reduce errors and streamline batch release processes.
        MES tracks raw materials, intermediates, and finished products, ensuring proper storage conditions (e.g., cold storage for biological materials) and reducing waste.
