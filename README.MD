### Learnings and Challenges

- I made the website with the default project topic where it's a portfolio showcasing my work and interests
- There is a home page, a page of some of my hobbies, a page of some recent trips, my resume, and a contact page
- The CSS portion and the JavaScript by far took the longest, particularly for the JavaScript functions on the home page with the incrementing stats and auto scrolling carousel. The card flipping effect on the travel pages were also particularly time consuming. 
- Working with images was harder than I anticipated. It was tough to display them in a way where landscape and portrait style pictures could be displayed in the same row without looking too small or getting cropped.
- I went with the no-build approach for React. I had already done a significant amount of work by the time I started learning React in Module 5 and it seemed to big of a risk to move the entire project to React so late.

### Above and Beyond

- I added a lot of visual effects like the card flipping, the lightbox effect, the incrementing stats, which I think added a lot of life to the page
- I spent a lot of time on the CSS portion, I think that was the part I enjoyed the most because I like the limitless amount of customization that can be applied
- I wanted to add videos to interests section so that it wasn't just pictures and too similar to the travel section, so I put some of my waterski and snowski videos through this program called ClipChamp which makes a quick video edit for you with the videos you feed into it
- I used Grid and CSS Media Queries throughout each page to the website flexible
